# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN-model-
Introduction:
Breast Cancer Detection using CNN Model is a project aimed at leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the early detection of breast cancer. The project utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze medical images, specifically mammograms, to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer.

Purpose:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate tool for detecting breast cancer at an early stage. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates associated with breast cancer. By employing CNNs, which are known for their effectiveness in image recognition tasks, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.

Features:

Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are employed to analyze mammogram images and identify patterns indicative of breast cancer.
Early Detection: The system is designed to identify potential signs of breast cancer at an early stage, facilitating timely medical intervention.
User-friendly Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface for easy interaction, enabling medical professionals to utilize the tool effectively.
